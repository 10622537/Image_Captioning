# Image_Captioning

### GOAL
Combining computer vision and natural language processing to build
an image captioning AI. Uses pre-trained image recognition models
like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then using a
recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images.
